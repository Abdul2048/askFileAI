Here's a simple Python script that counts the number of multiplication operations in the provided code. The total number of multiplications is calculated based on the size of matrices `A` and `B`. In the context of matrix multiplication, for each element in the resulting matrix, there are `cols_A * cols_B` multiplications.

```python
def count_multiplications_in_code(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()

        # Find occurrences of '*' operator within loops related to matrix multiplication
        # This assumes that the only place we expect this operation is inside the 'matmul' function
        start_index = content.find("def matmul(A, B):")
        end_index = content.rfind("\n\n", 0, start_index)
        code_snippet = content[end_index + 2:start_index].strip()

        count = sum(code.count('*') for line in code_snippet.split('\n') if 'result[i][j] = result[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]' in line)

    return count

file_path = "C:\\Users\\abdul\\exp_agent1\\py_code.py"
print("Number of multiplications in the code:", count_multiplications_in_code(file_path))
```

### Explanation:

- The `count_multiplications_in_code` function opens and reads the content of the file at the given path.
- It locates the specific section of interest (the `matmul` function definition) within the code snippet by finding the start point after "def matmul(A, B):" and then finds where this segment ends before it starts again.
- It processes each line in this extracted code block to count occurrences of the '*' symbol following 'A[i][k] * B[k][j]', which represents multiplication operations in matrix multiplication context. This assumes that there are no other contexts for using '*' outside of these specific lines.

### Usage:

1. Run this script.
2. It will print out the total number of multiplications found within the `matmul` function definition from your provided file path.

This script provides a straightforward way to analyze and count multiplication operations in the given code snippet without requiring any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library functionality.
