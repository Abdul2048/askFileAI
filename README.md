# 🧠 AskFileAI

**Turn any file into a smart assistant!**

**AskFileAI** is a clever little Python app that lets you ask questions or request actions on any file — and it uses AI to figure out and run the right Python code to do it. Just give it a file and a task, and it takes care of the rest!

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

AskFileAI is like having a coding assistant that:

1. **Reads your file** 📄
2. **Understands your task** 🤔
3. **Asks an AI model what to do** 🧠
4. **Extracts the Python code** 🐍
5. **Runs the code for you** ⚙️
6. **Logs everything neatly** 📝

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. You run the app and give it:

   * The path to a file
   * A task (like “Count the words” or “Find all function names”)
2. It sends the file and task to a local LLM (Large Language Model)
3. The LLM replies with Python code to do the job
4. That code is pulled out and run automatically
5. You see the results, and everything is saved in a `log.txt` file

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have:

* Python 3.7+
* These packages:

  ```bash
  pip install langgraph requests
  ```
* A local LLM running via **Ollama**, such as `qwen2:7b`

  * It must be available at: `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`

## ▶️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdul2048/AskFileAI.git
   cd AskFileAI
   ```

2. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:

   * Enter the file path
   * Describe what you want done with that file

4. **Watch the magic happen**:

   * The AI responds
   * Code is extracted and run
   * The result is shown and logged

## 📦 What's in the Box?

| File              | What it does                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`          | Main app — builds and runs the logic graph    |
| `file_input.py`   | Takes user input and reads file content       |
| `askllm.py`       | Sends prompt to the LLM and receives response |
| `extract_code.py` | Finds Python code in the LLM’s message        |
| `run_code.py`     | Executes the extracted code safely            |
| `append_file.py`  | Appends output and logs to a text file        |
| `state.py`        | Stores the app’s working memory (state)       |
| `requirements.py` | Shared imports and setup code                 |

## 📚 Example Tasks

Try something like:

* “Extract all email addresses from this file”
* “Summarize the content in 3 bullet points”
* “Convert this CSV to JSON”

## ⚠️ Caution

This app executes Python code generated by an AI. Always check the code and run in a safe environment.I prefer you do it making a CONDA environment.
